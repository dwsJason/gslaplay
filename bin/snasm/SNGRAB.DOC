SNGRAB.


SnGrab is a SNASM utility designed to 'grab' the contents of memory from a 
target machine and store it in a specified file(s) on the parent PC. SnGrab 
can then download from the specified file(s) to the target machine at a
later date.

SnGrab is used as follows: 

	sngrab [/t - target num] +|- inputfile
where :
	target is the SCSI ID of the active target (default 7)
	+|- indicate the direction of data transfer - '+' = to the target
	'-' = from the target
	inputfile contains filenames to read\write and their corresponding
	memory areas

The following example of an 'inputfile' is designed to upload the contents 
of the lowest 512K of memory on a SNES into the files r:\demo1-16.


!r:\demo1.bin
8000   to	10000
!r:\demo2.bin
18000 	to 	20000
!r:\demo3.bin
28000 	to 	30000
!r:\demo4.bin
38000 	to 	40000
!r:\demo5.bin
48000 	to 	50000
!r:\demo6.bin
58000 	to 	60000
!r:\demo7.bin
68000 	to 	70000
!r:\demo8.bin
78000 	to 	80000
!r:\demo9.bin
88000 	to 	90000
!r:\demo10.bin
98000 	to 	A0000
!r:\demo11.bin
A8000 	to 	B0000
!r:\demo12.bin
B8000 	to 	C0000
!r:\demo13.bin
C8000 	to 	D0000
!r:\demo14.bin
D8000 	to 	E0000
!r:\demo15.bin
E8000 	to 	F0000
!r:\demo16.bin
F8000 	to 	100000


The following would load the same memory areas into one file;demo.bin.


!demo.bin
8000   to	10000
18000 	to 	20000
28000 	to 	30000
38000 	to 	40000
48000 	to 	50000
58000 	to 	60000
68000 	to 	70000
78000 	to 	80000
88000 	to 	90000
98000 	to 	A0000
A8000 	to 	B0000
B8000 	to 	C0000
C8000 	to 	D0000
D8000 	to 	E0000
E8000 	to 	F0000
F8000 	to 	100000



Assuming that the 'inputfile' is called demo.dat the following command line
will upload the memory from the target machine

sngrab - demo.dat

and the following will download from the PC to the target

sngrab + demo.dat
